Downloaded Scala IDE from http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html

Eclipse is a pain to get used to after Visual Studio. All my cheese got moved. Installed Scala 2.11.7 from here: http://www.scala-lang.org/download/

Then added the bin folder to my path and just ran things from the command line:
scala HelloWorld.scala

That runs a scala shell and executes the code in the .scala file. Nice and easy. I'll mess with IDEs later.
