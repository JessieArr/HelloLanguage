Downloaded MinGW-w64 build with Ada from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/ray_linn/GCC-4.7.x-with-ada/

(For some reason Ada isn't included in all distros of MinGW-w64, but this one has it.)

Added path to bin folder which contains gnatbind, gnatlink etc.
