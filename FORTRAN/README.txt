Downloaded MinGW for Windows 64-bit here: http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php

Added bin directory to PATH, then compiled with "gfortran HelloWorld.f90" - worked just fine.

NOTE: Installed a different distro of MinGW-w64 which contains Ada. The one linked above doesn't have it. See Ada README for more info.
