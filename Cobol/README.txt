Just compiling and testing here for now: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cobol_online.php

Downloaded like 3 different Cobol compilers but none of them want to work on Windows x64. Language wasn't bad, by setting up my environment was hard. :(

Maybe I will fight this battle again one day, but after 90 minutes of failing to get Hello, World to compile on Win10, I give up. I'll let tutorialspoint.com do it for me, heh.
